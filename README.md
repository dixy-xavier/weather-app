Weather App - https://dixy-xavier.github.io/

## Explanation
The weather app shows the weather forecast of Munich city. It shows 5-6 days in total and only maximum 3 date's data will be shown at a time. Rest could be retrieved by clicking the arrow icons.

On click on each card it shows the bar graph of the temperature (maximum 8 readings) on that particular day in an interval of 3 hours.
